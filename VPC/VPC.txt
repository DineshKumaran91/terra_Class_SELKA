VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

 - Mainly uses so secure our environment which deployed in public cloud(Logically Isolate from the public cloud network).
 - We can control network related parameters..Example --> SubnetCreation,CIDR block(IP Range),Route Table and Gateway Config
 - Each Region has default VPC
 - Security wise VPC have lot of Layer to protect our product(ACL,Route Table)
 - We can connect VPC with use of VPN from a On-Premises(through Customer gateway)

Example:
 - App/Web server can be kept in Public VPC
 - DB can be kept in Private VPC(so no one can't access the DB from outside)
 - As default we can create 5 VPC in a region
